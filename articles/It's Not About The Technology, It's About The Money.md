# It's Not About The Technology, It's About The Money (2016)

Money is basically just **a socially-established number** that is objectively associated with a person. We each agree on how much everybody has, and have the ability to add/subtract from each other.

Different mediums can be used to enforce this number:
- physical - passing gold around
- centralized institution - [bank deposits](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/an-honest-account-of-fiat-money-2018)
- honor system - friends keeping tabs
- decentralized collective - Bitcoin
Multiple monies exist at any given time.

# Barter and Utility
The unique utility that money gives us **stored optionality** - the **ability to defer the decision** of what to receive in exchange for your work/goods.

This explains why people value money with gold-like properties more - they enable this behavior much better.

Someone who **does** **not want** to use money must, by definition, have a very good idea about what he wants to get in exchange for his goods/services.

# Intrinsic Value Fallacy
The foundational fallacy is that people try to explain money in physical terms when it is purely a **sociological phenomenon**.

Gold is **not** valuable because it is durable, fungible, portable, and scarce; it is valuable because of the **self-sustaining tradition** around it.
Its properties **enable** this, but **don't guarantee** it.

The same applies to Bitcoin. Itâ€™s why you **can't copy** Bitcoin's value by [forking the blockchain](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-2019) and adding extra features - the [shared socially-reinforcing belief](https://2minutebitcoin.org/blog/unpacking-bitcoins-social-contract-2018) of billions of people is impossible to replicate.

Similarly, if a new metal better than gold was found - it wouldn't inherit all its value.

# Network Effect
***Money becomes more useful and more valuable the more people use it.***

As more people begin to hold money, its value and utility **both** rise. The rational response of everyone else is to try to get more themselves, resulting in a positive upward spiral.

This incentive is at **the polar opposite** of conventional stocks. If a stock gets too expensive, its value decreases because an investor buys a smaller share of the company's revenue for more dollars.
Contrastly, $100 of Bitcoin today is **much more valuable** than $100 of Bitcoin years ago because it is spendable at **more** places.

This ***unique positive feedback*** between price and value makes the growth of Bitcoin self-sustaining. There is no top until everybody adopts it.

# Cream Rises to the Top
The positive feedback between demand and value means that money is **winner-take-all** in a free market. If one currency was ever-so-slightly more preferred than the other, then this imbalance will only grow until the other one collapses.

The word blockchain is thrown around with the idea of solving major problems, but there isn't much apparent use outside of currency. There are no applications of blockchains that do not involve a double-spending problem.

This is why Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency destined for success.

Bitcoin offers a 1000x improvement over fiat currencies, but no other cryptocurrencies offer a [1000x improvement]( https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/saylor-series-episode-2-the-rise-of-man-through-the-dark-and-steel-ages-robert-breedlove) over Bitcoin.
