Money has always been technology for making our wealth today available for consumption tomorrow.

Throughout history, various monies have always existed simultaneously along a continuum of soundness.

Each human’s Darwinian instinct naturally optimizes for the **soundest money** - the one that will best store the sum total of our daily labor (**our life force**).

To save is **intuition** as unstoppable as [evolution](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/saylor-series-the-rise-of-man-through-the-stone-and-iron-ages-episode-1-2020) because humans understand their survival is at stake.

# Toxic Centralization
The edifice of central banking is to print money to stabilize the economy.

Through unintended side effects, they cripple the wisest regulator - **the market** and therefore end up being the ultimate cause of economic problems.

# Big Three Bitcoin Aha-Moments

# 1. Perfectly Inelastic Supply
Bitcoin is the first store of value in history whose supply is **unaffected** by increased demand.

Gold was the soundest money because of its scarcity and steady supply growth of 1-2% a year. But if gold went 10x up tomorrow, the annual supply growth would skyrocket because more miners would come to extract more gold from the Earth.

Unlike gold, Bitcoin **cannot** be mined faster, making unexpected inflation impossible.

Bitcoin is, therefore, more **salable across time**.

# 2. Salability Across Space
Despite [fiat](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/an-honest-account-of-fiat-money-2018)’s massive regression in salability across **time** ([demonetization](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/bitcoin-hypermonetization-bubble-talk-2013) through hyperinflation), it was an enormous step forward in salability across **space**. Gold is tough to transport.

Contrary to common belief, Bitcoin moves **much faster** across space than fiat.

Bitcoin completes [final settlement](https://www.2minutebitcoin.org/blog/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-2019) in an hour, whereas current state-of-the-art international settlement takes 3-5 days (some even longer) - **96 times slower**.

A Visa payment is **not** final settlement - no settlement occurs when you buy a coffee at Starbucks. Your bank and Starbucks’ bank generally settle 2-3 days later, each taking **credit risk** for the time being.

Not only is it faster, but as a bearer instrument, Bitcoin **doesn’t** suffer from credit risk either.

# 3. Energy
Bitcoin mining is the **first** and **only** profitable use of energy in human history that is **location-independent**.
It can be done from anywhere.

This unique trait allows it to finance (bootstrap) the development of cheap, clean energy infrastructure in remote, **previously-isolated** places on a massive scale.
Since fossil fuels are expensive, the only long-term profitable Bitcoin mining will be powered by **hydro**.

Historically, our energy challenge has been to **bring energy to the people**.
All the world’s cities were geographically located there because of waterways and trade routes - energy was not a factor because they predated it.
Bitcoin enables us to **bring people to the energy**.

Beyond its revolution in monetary policy - Bitcoin can also be the **most significant catalyst** the world has ever known for developing abundant, clean, cheap energy.

Counter-intuitively, Bitcoin can serve as the tool that enables humanity to transition to a more abundant and sustainable energy future.
